# Backbone.js Presentation

This is a presentation I gave on [Backbone.JS](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone) to the St. Louis JavaScript Meetup [(STLJS)](http://www.stljs.org) on 11/17/2011. The goal of this presentation is to familiarize the audience with the blocks rather than the building. Additionally, it should be noted that prior to preparing these slides, I had no knowledge of backbone's workings. I reserve the right to be wrong!

The presentation output can be viewed [here](http://jeffsigmon.github.com/backbone-stljs).

The presentation files are designed to work with [showoff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff).
